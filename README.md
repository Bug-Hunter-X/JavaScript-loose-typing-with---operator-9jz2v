# JavaScript loose typing with + operator This code demonstrates an uncommon error in JavaScript related to loose typing and the + operator.  The + operator will concatenate strings rather than perform mathematical addition if either operand is a string. This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution shows how to explicitly type check and handle different data types to avoid this issue.
